# Python Challenge
  
# I created a new repository called 'python-challenge' for this project

# I uploaded the following to my GitHub 'python-challenge' repository for my submission:

# I uploaded two folders named 'PyBank' and 'PyPoll' to the 'python-challenge' repository

# Each 'PyBank' and 'PyPoll' folder contains a 'Resources' folder which contains its respective csv file dataset that the python script will analyze

# Each 'PyBank' and 'PyPoll' folder contains a file called 'main.py' which contains python script to analyze its respective dataset
  
# Each 'PyBank' and 'PyPoll' folder contains a 'Analysis' folder which contains its respective .txt file generated with script analyis results

# Each of the main.py files are set up to their relative paths to be auto-adjusted and print to the terminal and to produce a .txt file as output to your directory's 'Resource' folder. The scripts are written to analyze their respective 'PyBank' and 'PyPoll' datasets.
 
 # I uploaded this README.md file to accompany my submission
 
 # I created this shareable link to my repository <https://github.com/jdelacruzjr/python-challenge.git> and submitted that to to <https://bootcampspot-v2.com>
